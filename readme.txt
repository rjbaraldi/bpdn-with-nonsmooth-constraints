Everything (as of 11/13/2018) should be organized by examples in the IEEE paper version. The first example comes from the folder L1denoise, where we generate a random sparse signal and add large sparse noise to it. The third example is low-rank interpolation on a 4d model (aptly named 4d). The code that generates the figures and sames them in the appropriate TextOnly file is "inter_w.m". All examples call respective algorithms located in 'alg_tools.m'.
